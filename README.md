# Xkcd apps in Objective-C and Swift.

These are two simple example iOS apps - one written in Objective-C and one written in Swift - that I presented at [Barcamp Orlando 2014](http://barcamporlando.org) on September 27, 2014.

The apps download a list of available [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/) comics and present them reverse chronologically.  Selecting one of the comics displays it along with a date and title in a detail view where the UIImageView can be zoomed.

I built the app in Objective-C, and then converted it to Swift so I could highlight some changes and issues when switching to Swift.

I also included a Swift Playground called `DateDifference.playground` with the sample "calculate days between two dates" code at the end of the slides.
